Choosing Python version

In SourceLair, the default Python version is 2.7.6. However, you are able to choose between Python 2.7.6 and 3.4.3.

In order to activate Python 3.4.3 all you have to do is paste the following command in your terminal:


mkdir -p /mnt/data/.local/bin && ln -fs $(which python3) /mnt/data/.local/bin/python && ln -fs $(which pip3) /mnt/data/.local/bin/pip


In order to activate Python 2.7.6, paste the following command in your terminal:
mkdir -p /mnt/data/.local/bin && ln -fs $(which python2) /mnt/data/.local/bin/python && ln -fs $(which pip2) /mnt/data/.local/bin/pip

Right after changing your Python version make sure you restart your server as well as your terminal for the change to take effect. Any process (server, terminal, run file, etc) that starts after the change will run with the newly selected Python version.

At any time, if you want to check the currently active Python version you can run the following command in your terminal:
python --version

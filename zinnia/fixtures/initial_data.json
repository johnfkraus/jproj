Journalism, however, is not always confined to the news media or to news itself, as journalistic communication may find its way into broader forms of expression, including literature and cinema. In some nations, the news media is controlled by government intervention, and is not a fully independent body.[3]\r\n\r\nIn a democratic society, however, access to free information plays a central role in creating a system of checks and balance, and in distributing power equally amongst governments, businesses, individuals, and other social entities. Access to verifiable information gathered by independent media sources, which adhere to journalistic standards, can also be of service to ordinary citizens, by empowering them with the tools they need in order to participate in the political process.\r\n\r\nThe role and status of journalism, along with that of the mass media, has undergone profound changes over the last two decades with the advent of digital technology and publication of news on the Internet.[4] This has created a shift in the consumption of print media channels, as people increasingly consume news through e-readers, smartphones, and other electronic devices, challenging news organizations to fully monetize their digital wing, as well as improvise on the context in which they publish news in print. Notably, in the American media landscape, newsrooms have reduced their staff and coverage as traditional media channels, such as television, grapple with declining audiences. For instance, between 2007 and 2012, CNN edited its story packages into nearly half of their original time length.[5]\r\n\r\nThis compactness in coverage has been linked to broad audience attrition, as a large majority of respondents in recent studies show changing preferences in news consumption.[6] The digital era has also ushered in a new kind of journalism in which ordinary citizens play a greater role in the process of news making, with the rise of citizen journalism being possible through the Internet. Using video camera equipped smartphones, active citizens are now enabled to record footage of news events and upload them onto channels like YouTube, which is often discovered and used by mainstream news media outlets. Meanwhile, easy access to news from a variety of online sources, like blogs and other social media, has resulted in readers being able to pick from a wider choice of official and unofficial sources, instead of only from traditional media organizations.\r\n", "comment_enabled": true, "creation_date": "2015-11-24T20:21:32Z", "authors": [1], "start_publication": null, "slug": "what-journalism-wikipedia-free-encyclopedia", "status": 2, "trackback_enabled": true, "trackback_count": 0, "content_template": "zinnia/_entry_detail.html", "sites": [1], "last_update": "2015-11-26T15:14:48.954Z", "pingback_enabled": true, "login_required": false, "image": "uploads/zinnia/2015/11/24/800px-simons_perskaart_dom_v2UL3S5.jpg", "end_publication": null, "categories": [24], "featured": true, "detail_template": "entry_detail.html", "tags": "print,hoarding", "pingback_count": 0, "image_caption": "\"Simons Perskaart DOM\" by Marie-Anne08 - Own work.

He pulled out an article, smiled, and the next thing I knew, he was sucked headfirst into the rotary casing.\"\r\n\r\n\"We couldn't shut it down,\" continued Paxton, adding that the smell of mutilated remains mixed with raw Internet media was gag-inducing. \"If we had, it would have taken a full day for the technicians to reset it, and we couldn't risk missing a breaking story on Brody Jenner.\"\r\n\r\nSince The Huffington Post was founded in 2005, its headquarters has consisted of two rooms: Arianna Huffington's spacious, lav\u00adishly appointed office overlooking New York City, and the windowless 10,000-square-foot subterranean warehouse that houses the turbine. More than 700 low-wage workers, known as writers, clock in every day, and, dressed in their Huffington Post hard hats and coveralls, work in dark, unsafe conditions to ensure the machine runs smoothly and constantly churns out content.\r\n'Huffington Post' writers following a typical 16-hour turbine shift.\r\n\r\nOperating at 5,100 rpm, or the equivalent of 2,500 online articles and videos per minute, the turbine uses its massive power to sweep the Internet for stories or photos that ensure HuffingtonPost.com receives enough page views and mouse clicks to appease advertisers.\r\n\r\nThough Evers had worked with the com\u00adpany for 11 months, reports indicate he was unaware the turbine often overheats and malfunctions when tasked with posting an article of more than 400 words.\r\n\r\n\"Evers was pulverized,\" said Aaron Thomas, a spokesperson for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. \"There was no way to identify him. No dental remains, no hair samples, just eyewitness reports and 17 cell-phone camera videos that the turbine immediately threw up on the site under the tags 'Funny' and 'OMG.'\"\r\n\r\n\"In a way, though, maybe it's a good thing he was ripped to shreds and killed,\" added Thomas, later saying that because The Huffington Post didn't provide Evers with health insurance, he wouldn't have been able to afford his hospital bills, anyway. \"Working the HuffPo turbine is no way to live.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to sources, editor-in-chief Ari\u00adanna Huffington appeared shaken after the incident, asking if the turbine was broken, if it would need to be replaced, and if the horrific accident would affect the posting of a \"Worst Hair In Hollywood\" celebrity feature.\r\n\r\n\"When you harvest as much content as we do, there are bound to be some fatalities,\" Huffington said in a statement. \"That's just part of the job.\"\r\n\r\nRepresentatives from the website said that to honor Evers' memory, they planned to post a slide show titled \"25 Funniest Animal Photobombs We Think Henry Would Have Loved\" as early as tomorrow.\r\n", "comment_enabled": true, "creation_date": "2015-11-25T00:14:45Z", "authors": [1], "start_publication": null, "slug": "huffington-post-employee-sucked-aggregation-turbine", "status": 2, "trackback_enabled": true, "trackback_count": 0, "content_template": "zinnia/_entry_detail.html", "sites": [1], "last_update": "2015-11-26T15:15:28.179Z", "pingback_enabled": true, "login_required": false, "image": "uploads/zinnia/2015/11/25/huffington-aggregation-engine.jpg", "end_publication": null, "categories": [4], "featured": true, "detail_template": "entry_detail.html", "tags": "mayhem,aggregation", "pingback_count": 0, "image_caption": "The Huffington Post started using the turbine in earnest when the creation of actual original content was deemed cost-prohibitive.\r\n", "comment_count": 0, "title": "'Huffington Post' Employee Sucked Into Aggregation Turbine", "lead": "Horrified Workers Watch As Colleague Torn Apart By Powerful Content-Gathering Engine\r\n\r\n", "related": []}, "pk": 3}]
